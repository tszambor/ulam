Implementation related to Ulam's Sprial problem


The code is inspired by the work of polish mathematician, Stanislaw Ulam (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam).

Ulam Sprial is a graphical representation of prime numbers along a spiral, which shows a tendency of the numbers appearing on a diagonal lines. You can read more about the phenomena of Ulam's Spiral within the following article - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral

The code uses a StdDraw library (http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/). The library accompanies Introduction to Programming in Java book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, which is an excellent primer to programming in general. You can get the book here: http://amzn.to/VJEuO0
